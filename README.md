## What?
Did you ever wonder: "Where did this guy even find this bizarre profile picture?"...
Well, look no further! Now you can have one too!

## What's wrong with you?  
Honestly, I don't know. But this script is the result of me getting tired of searching for a nice profile picture, and so I thought I'd generate them myself.

It's nothing fancy, and probably won't appeal to many people, but I find the simplistic patterns and the shapes some of these create to be pleasant to look at.

Before you download this life-changing piece of code, you can check some examples in the folder up there.
Some of the patterns will look better at larger sizes (like *rays*), some of them will take longer (like *labyrinth*, especially if it's a bit too large), and so on.
You'll have to tweak the different parameters (density/color/size) yourself until you find one you like.

Enjoy?

(oh and, you'll need *Pygame* for this to work..why? because I love creating unnecessary problems for myself)
